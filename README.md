# Van Trip Explorer

Welcome to **Van Trip Explorer** – a modern front-end portfolio project that showcases a rich web app for planning and exploring van trips. This project demonstrates a wide variety of contemporary web technologies, tools, and libraries. Below you'll find an overview of the stack and key features implemented.

## 🚦 Technologies Used

### Languages & Build Tools
- **TypeScript**: Structured, statically-typed JavaScript for scalable code.
- **Vite**: Ultra-fast front-end build tooling, hot-reload, and optimized bundling.

### Framework & Libraries
- **React**: Modern, component-based UI library for building interactive SPAs.
- **React DOM**: Virtual DOM and rendering support.
- **React Router**: Declarative routing and navigation for React apps.
- **React Bootstrap**: Bootstrap components brought to React for sleek and responsive UI.
- **Bootstrap**: Styling framework for rapid, mobile-first UI development.
- **clsx**: Utility library for efficiently combining class names.
- **Leaflet**: Powerful open-source library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.
- **React Leaflet**: React components for integrating Leaflet maps with React.
- **Firebase**: Backend-as-a-service for authentication, data storage, and more.

### Development & Quality Tools
- **ESLint**: Code quality and linting for clean, maintainable code.
- **TypeScript ESLint**: Typed linting tailored for TypeScript.
- **@eslint/js, eslint-plugin-react-hooks, eslint-plugin-react-refresh**: Extended lint rules for hooks and efficient development.
- **Globals**: Definitions for global variables in environments.
- **@vitejs/plugin-react**: Optimized React integration for Vite.
- **@types/...**: Type declarations for better Intellisense and type-checking.
